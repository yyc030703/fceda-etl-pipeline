## üìå Project Overview  

Public business registration data in Virginia provides valuable insights for economic development but is often **messy, inconsistent, and time-consuming to process**.  
The FCEDA needed a **scalable, automated solution** to clean, validate, and visualize this data to enhance outreach efforts and strategic planning.  

Our team developed a **cloud-based ETL pipeline** leveraging AWS services and an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to transform raw datasets into actionable intelligence.

## ‚ùå Problem Statement  

Prior to this project, FCEDA faced significant challenges:  
- Manual, time-intensive data cleaning slowed business outreach  
- Difficulty validating whether businesses were physically located within Fairfax County  
- Limited ability to visualize trends by city, ZIP code, or industry over time

## ‚úÖ Our Solution  

We designed a **serverless data processing and visualization platform** that:  

-  **Automates** ingestion, cleaning, and standardization of Virginia business registration data  
-  **Geocodes** addresses to determine Fairfax County boundaries  
-  **Visualizes** data with a user-friendly Tableau dashboard  

### üîë Key Components  
- **AWS Lambda + S3:** Serverless pipeline for cleaning, merging, and enriching datasets  
- **Amazon Location Service:** Adds latitude and longitude to enable spatial filtering  
- **Tableau Dashboard:** Interactive business intelligence tool with advanced filters and mapping  
- **Outputs:** Cleaned CSV datasets automatically prepared for Tableau, Salesforce, and ArcGIS
